# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data, visualizing trends in cases, recoveries, and deaths across different countries and continents. The analysis aims to uncover meaningful insights into the pandemic's impact through data visualization and statistical analysis.

## Objectives
- Track and visualize COVID-19 case evolution over time
- Compare vaccination rates across selected countries
- Analyze the relationship between demographic factors (like median age) and COVID-19 impact
- Identify trends in recovery rates and mortality by region
- Create interactive visualizations for better understanding of pandemic patterns

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python:** Primary programming language for data manipulation and analysis
- **Pandas:** For data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating visualizations including line charts and area charts
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive code execution and documentation
- **GitHub:** For version control and project sharing

## How to Run/View the Project
1. Clone the repository:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Kaballah/COVID-19-Analysis.git
  ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and launch Jupyter Notebook

3. Open the main analysis notebook to view the visualizations and analysis

## Key Visualizations
- Line charts tracking cumulative cases and deaths over time
- Comparative analysis of vaccination percentages across countries
- Area charts displaying top continents by total COVID-19 cases
- Statistical analysis of the relationship between median age and case severity

## Insights and Reflections
This project demonstrates how data analysis can provide a deeper understanding of global health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Through visualizations, we can identify patterns that might not be immediately apparent in raw data, such as:

- Regional differences in pandemic progression
- Effectiveness of vaccination campaigns
- Potential correlations between demographic factors and disease impact

The analysis serves as a foundation for further research and can be expanded as more data becomes available. Future work could include predictive modeling and more detailed analysis of policy impacts on pandemic outcomes.
